# FastHTML

> FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's `FT` "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications.

FastHTML is written by Answer.AI, an organization which follows the fast.ai style guide instead of PEP 8, so most examples follow fast.ai style.
