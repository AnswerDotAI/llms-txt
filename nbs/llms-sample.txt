# FastHTML

> FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's `FT` "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications.

Remember:

- Use `serve()` for running uvicorn (`if __name__ == "__main__"` is not needed since it's automatic)
- When a title is needed with a response, use `Titled`; note that that already wraps children in `Container`, and already includes both the meta title as well as the H1 element.
