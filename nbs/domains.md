# llms.txt in Different Domains

This page has some guidelines and suggestions for how different domains could utilize `llms.txt` to allow LLMs to better interface with their site if they so choose.

Remember, when constructing your `llms.txt` you should "use concise, clear language. When linking to resources, include brief, informative descriptions. Avoid ambiguous terms or unexplained jargon." Additionally, the best way to determine if your `llms.txt` works well with LLMs is to test it with them! Here is a minimal way to test Anthropic's Claude against your `llms.txt`:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.8"
# dependencies = [
#     "claudette",
#     "llms-txt",
#     "requests",
# ]
# ///
from claudette import *
from llms_txt import create_ctx

import requests

model = models[1] # Sonnet 3.5
chat = Chat(model, sp="""You are a helpful and concise assistant.""")

url = 'your_url/llms.txt'
text = requests.get(url).text
llm_ctx = create_ctx(text)
chat(llm_ctx + '\n\nThe above is necessary context for the conversation.')

while True:
    msg = input('Your question about the site: ')
    res = chat(msg)
    print('From Claude:', contents(res))
```

The above script utilizes the relatively new [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) syntax for python scripts. If you install `uv`, you can simply run the above script with `uv run test_llms_txt.py` and it will handle installing the necessary library dependencies in an isolated python environment. Else you can install the requirements manually and run it like any ordinary python script with `python test_llms_txt.py`.

## Restaurants

Here is an example `llms.txt` that a restaurant could construct for consumption by LLMs:
