# `ed`, the standard text editor

In order to understand how llms.txt can be used with editors and IDEs, let's look at how `ed`, the [standard text editor](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.html), could work (assuming it's updated to use this proposal). In our example we will look at how the user might then tell `ed` to retrieve the LLM docs from [docs.fastht.ml](https://docs.fastht.ml), and then use the results to write a simple [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml) web app.

Even if you use a non-standard editor or IDE such as vscode, Cursor, vim, or Emacs, your software's interaction with `/llms.txt` would look similar to this general approach.

```sh
$ ed
* H
```

Our user starts `ed` and enables helpful error messages (just for the purpose of this walkthru - obviously a real `ed` user doesn't need "helpful error messages").

```sh
* l docs.fastht.ml
Checking for /llms.txt at docs.fastht.ml...
Found /llms.txt. Parsing...
Fetching URLs from "Docs" section...  Fetching URLs from "Examples" section...
Skipping "Optional" section for brevity.
Creating XML-based context for Claude...  Context created and loaded.
```

The user invokes the hypothetical `l` (load) command, which in this LLM-enhanced version of `ed` retrieves and processes the `llms.txt` file. `ed` checks for the file (if it didn't exist, it would fall back to scraping the HTML of the website the old-fashioned way), parses it, fetches the relevant URLs, and creates an XML-based context suitable for Claude (perhaps an `ed` config file could be used to choose what LLM to use, and would determine how the context is formatted). All of this happens with the characteristic silence of `ed`, broken only by these reassuring progress messages.

```sh
* x Create a simple FastHTML app which outputs 'Hello, World!', in a <div>.
Analyzing context and prompt...
Generating FastHTML app...
App written to buffer.
```

Next, our user invokes the hypothetical `x` (eXecute AI) command, providing instructions for the LLM to create a simple FastHTML app. In the world of LLM-enhanced `ed`, this is understood as a request to generate code based on the given prompt and the previously loaded context.

```sh
* n
5
* p
from fasthtml.common import *
app,rt = fast_app()
@rt
def index(): return div("Hello, World!")
serve()
```

The editor analyzes the loaded context along with the provided prompt, generates the FastHTML app, and writes it to the buffer. The user then views the generated app line count (`n`) and contents (`p`), marveling at how much functionality is packed into those 5 lines.

```sh
*w hello_world.py
5
*q
```

Finally, our user saves the app to a file and quits `ed`, presumably to run their new FastHTML app and reflect on the unexpected productivity boost provided by their trusty line editor.
